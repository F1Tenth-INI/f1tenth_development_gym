This is auxiliary file used while running ./SI_Toolkit_ASF/run/Create_normalization_file.py.
If apply_user_defined_normalization_correction is defined it allows overwriting selected data statistics,
mean, std, max, min, replacing values calculated from data with user defined values.
This is useful if you a priori know that some features should be symmetric or cover some particular range.
