# SI_Toolkit_ApplicationSpecificFiles

Only relevant if you are setting up SI_Toolkit
for a completely new project!

SI_Toolkit relies on some scripts
which need to be customized
for each project separately.

We provide the template for the necessary files
in SI_Toolkit_ApplicationSpecificFiles_Template folder.
Please copy this folder outside of SI_Toolkit
AND
rename it to SI_Toolkit_ApplicationSpecificFiles.

Most of the functions it contains
does not need to be modified for basic functionalities.
You will however surely need to modify the cofig.yml.

In fact, first thing you should do
is to provide list of Control Inputs, State Inputs and Outputs of neural network.
